# Description 

There is a single page that shows a user list table with pagination, enabling efficient navigation through the data. The table supports multi-filter functionality, allowing users to search and filter the data dynamically based on criteria such as name (using a debounced search input), date of birth (via a date range picker), and gender (through a dropdown selector).
